# First Java Diary after Coronacation

First, my fear of having to catch up by a lot was taken from me.
I'm rather in good midfield, no reason to be scared, gonna work with dedication, no homework required.

"Personenverwalung" and "Fotografieren" were rather easy, only complications were:
* learning to make an instance of an object and add it to a list without declaring a distinct variable
* "removePerson()" method was instanced with a "new" person, therefor the equals() method had to be overwriten as well, always override hash with it. the standard return value from he autogenerated equal override function was not working and wasn't understood
* having a static variable (camera/lens counter) doesn't need a setter/getter if the modification is written in the class itself, just from outside(main) it is used
