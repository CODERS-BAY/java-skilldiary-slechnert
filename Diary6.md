# EZ fkin life

Like maybe not too easy, **Game of Life** was kind of a hassle, but the one hint that made it work, was my way of overwriting Arrays in he Game of Life.<br>
```array = arrayNew``` <br>
Was utter dogshit, as it made both variables point towards the same "memory slot", therefor I had no array before and after from the second step on, and the changes interferred with themselves, based on the order in which the array was scanned and manipulated

## Test
Was fine as well, roman numbers had me thinkin for a bit, felt like a very unelegant but easy solution.
Prime numbers were ez shit, numberphile or veritasium has given the hint that the 5 first prime numbers are all that is needed to divide by to check efficiently.
Knowledge questions were pretty basic, google to verify still was nice.

## Fibonacci

So we meet again, fkin hellspawn recursions.
This was a case of just get the syntax right and use the formula from Wikipedia.

I guess going throuh the method step by step gives insight on how it works, but I don't care bout why the easter formula works either.<br>
This course is mainly about coding, maths is less important.
