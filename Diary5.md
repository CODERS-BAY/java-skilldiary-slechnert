# still Arrays

## Sorting algorithms are fun
Pretty basic, nothing fancy.
Was kinda confused for a sec, as I thought I made an insertion sort but actually did the bubble sort, didn't take too long figuring out and fixing tho.

## Game of life
Looked rather easy, wasn't as easy to code.

I mean it looks pretty straightforward, I though it was working but I didn't really test it with multiple outputs, but after incorporating the border(just limiting the scan to 1/1 - max-1/max-1) shit was fked.<br>
IDK what this shit is about but I am definitely going to figure it out!
