# Classes are fun!

Finally learned about private and public, with the beautiful picture of private being america, with parameters that can only be written and read from the wall (public) but not from external sources. <br>

Get and Set are the methods used to manipulate private parameters.

Classes are part of the "class object", that parent each class we are creating, hence them being complex data types, even when only filled with primitive types.
Complex data types being wrapper classes, inhereting methods like compareTo and so on, allow for sorted arrays and all that kind of shit. 

Array lists are fun and ALT + Insert is the master hotkey, constructors, toString Overrides and much more good stuff tied to it, that makes life easier. Thanks advanced IDE.
