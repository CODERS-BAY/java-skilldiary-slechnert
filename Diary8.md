# Stupid little mistakes are no joke

just one reference in MergeSort was fked, pia found and fixed it, e voila, merge is working fine.

Divide and conquer was stupid easy after almost finishing merge sort thinking it was d&c.

Recursion is fun and methods are even more, gonna go for methods whenever I can now.

Don't really know what to put here other than go focus while writing, saves time debugging!
