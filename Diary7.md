# BINGOOOO

Bingo card generator was rather easy, just use random numbers 0-15, add 1 if 0(bingo has no 0), and add 15*loop counter to get the columns (1-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75).<br>
Add in a nice printf loop and watch the majesty unfold.
Not even gonna add a snippet, nothing to see her.

# Divide & Conquer

*Let's*<br>
*not*<br>
*talk*<br>
*about*<br>
*it....*<br>

Recursion like folding paper 8 times. U can kinda imagine it but actually doing it seems impossible.

**I feel like the split is working well, I HAVE NO GODDAMN FUCKING CLUE WHY MERGE IS NOT!**
